# Workflow change log

> ***Note:** The initial GeneLab Illumina metagenomics sequencing data processing pipeline, [GL-DPPD-7101](../../Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7107_Versions/GL-DPPD-7107.md), was wrapped in a Snakemake workflow and can be found in the [SW_MGIllumina](../SW_MGIllumina) directory. The current pipeline version, [GL-DPPD-7101-A](../../Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7107_Versions/GL-DPPD-7107-A.md), is wrapped in a Nextflow workflow and can be found in the [NF_MGIllumina](./) directory. This change log details changes for the Nextflow workflow implementation only.*    

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MGIllumina_1.0.0/Metagenomics/Illumina/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MGIllumina)
- workflow version that converted snakemake to nextflow
